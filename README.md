> Physician Detection of Clinical Harm in Machine Translation: Quality Estimation Aids in Reliance and Backtranslation Identifies Critical Errors. Nikita Mehandru, Sweta Agrawal, Yimin Xiao, Ge Gao, Elaine Khoong, Marine Carpuat, Niloufar Salehi. Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

We include the following:
1. The survey we adminstered via Qualtrics to the sixty-five physicians in our randomized experiment.
2. The experiment results from physicians in the backtranslation (BT) and quality estimation (QE) treatment groups (btqe_raw-data). 
3. An annotated set of Emergency Department discharge instructions that bilingual physicians evaluated for adequacy and clinical risk.
4. Plots of the analyses in our paper were generated using Python 3.10.
5. Code for how we designed the QE thresholds.
